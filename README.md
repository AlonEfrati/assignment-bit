This program uses an xgboost regressor model to predict the price of second hand machine for commercial purpose. 

For running the program the following steps are required:

RUNNING main.py and visual.ipynb
1) download python 3.7 or higher 
2) install the required packages with pip or anaconda 
    - pandas
    - sklearn
    - numpy
    - xgboost
    - seaborn
    - matplotlib
    - jupyter
3) run main.py in terminal/console or any ide of choice
5) run visual.ipynb in jupyter notebook or jupyter lab
6) the main.py code terminates when the results are printed and the scatter plot is shown with the corresponding r2 score

visual.ipynb shows the code and visualization of the data 
main.py is the code for preprocessing, training, and evaluating of the model
